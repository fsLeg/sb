PrismLauncher (An Open Source Minecraft launcher)

An Open Source Minecraft launcher with the ability to manage multiple
instances, accounts and mods. Focused on user freedom and free
redistributability.

A Microsoft or Mojang account that owns Minecraft is required to
download and play the game through PrismLauncher.

To build PrismLauncher you can use any JDK version (8..25) and variant
(Oracle JDK, OpenJDK, Zulu OpenJDK) starting from JDK 8. Keep in mind,
however, that different mods and Minecraft versions may need different
Java versions.

1.20.5 or newer: JDK 21
1.17 to 1.20.4:  JDK 17
1.16 or older:   JDK 8

If you have multiple versions of Java installed on your system, make
sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is pointed to correct
version of Java.

scdoc is an optional dependency. If present at build time, a man page
for PrismLauncher will be generated.
